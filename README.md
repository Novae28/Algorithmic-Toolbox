# Algorithmic-Toolbox
Coursera Algorithmic toolbox solutions.

This is a repository of solutions of the Coursera Algorithmic Toolbox course. I would request you to solve each problem yourself, and then look-up for solution if needed. You can suggest changes/alternate solution for the problem. This specialisation course is full of interesting problems to solve. The additional resources (including books) are added for reference.

Hope you find it helpful!
(I am open for any sort of collaboration on a python project.)
