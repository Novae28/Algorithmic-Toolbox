# Algorithmic-Toolbox
Coursera Algorithmic toolbox solutions.

This is a repository of solutions of the Coursera Algorithmic Toolbox course. I would request you to solve each problem yourself, and then look-up for solution if needed. You can suggest changes/alternate solution for the problem. 

Hope you find it helpful!
(I am open for any sort of collaboration on a python project.)
